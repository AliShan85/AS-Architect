        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. It is ASarchitect policy to respect your privacy regarding 
          any information we may collect from you across our website, and other sites and URLs we own and 
          operate under the brand ASarchitect, Plataforma Arquitectura, and its subsidiaries and related companies. 
          This privacy policy explains how we process the personal data obtained from our users. By using our website,

              <li>you declare your consent for us processing your personal data for internal administrative reasons; and</li>
              <li>you are deemed notified of such processing</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you do not agree with the processing of your personal data, please do not provide us with your personal data 
            via the ASarchitect website.
            We may update our privacy policy to reflect current acceptable practices. We will take reasonable steps to let users 
            know about changes via our website. If you are a registered user on our site, we will notify you using the contact details 
            saved in your account. Your continued use of this site after any changes to this policy will be regarded as acceptance of 
            our practices around privacy and personal information.
            If you accept these terms on behalf of a third party (such as an agency client), you confirm that the third party you 
            represent has read and understood the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy and that you’re authorized to accept them on their behalf.
          </p>
        <h3>2. Personal data we collect and how do we use it</h3>

        <h3>3. Main purposes of processing</h3>
        <p>
          We may use a combination of identifying and non-identifying information to understand who our visitors are, detect errors, 
          how they use our services, and how we may improve their experience of our website in future. It is used for organizational, 
          administrative, and internal reasons, and we do not disclose the specifics of this information publicly, but may share aggregated 
          and anonymised versions of this information, for example, in website and customer usage trend reports.
          We use your personal data for the construction of your profile, which allows you to submit, collect, aggregate, or share (both 
          privately or publicly) information. As you use our services, we will use, collect, store, record and structure this data to 
          improve and personalize the experience and/or features of our website. We have a legitimate interest for presenting you the content 
          that is relevant for you, and we show you the content based on the topics you follow on our website, in your personalised feed area. 
          We may also send you email updates with new content that matches the topics that you follow. You can manage your email notifications 
          from ASarchitect in your account settings page. However, we cannot exclude other ways of data processing, if necessary for the above 
          mentioned purposes. This data can be shared publicly, under your control and after your consent, and we give you control over it.
